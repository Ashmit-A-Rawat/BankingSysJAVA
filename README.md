**Bank Management System GUI**  

This is a desktop-based Bank Management System built using **Java Swing** and **AWT** for the graphical user interface. 
It allows users to perform banking operations such as account creation, deposit, withdrawal, account search, and deletion. 
The system is designed with an object-oriented approach, leveraging polymorphism through the implementation of a `CentralBank` interface.
